This project is an online coding platform powered by the Monaco Code Editor, allowing users to write, compile, and run code directly in the browser with support for C++, JavaScript, Java, and Python. The core objective is to offer a lightweight, fast, and highly customizable online coding environment that works for anyone — from casual coders to serious learners.

The platform provides two user modes:

Users can instantly start coding without creating an account. Features include:
 Select programming language (C++ / JS / Java / Python)
 Run and test code directly in the editor
 Customizable editor themes and font sizes
